# Astroshare

Astroshare is a Web3 based DeFi application that lets you manage shared expenses in a decentralized way.

## How Astroshare works

Astroshare is a cross-chain Web3 application made to keep track an manage your group expenses. It is built on the Moonbeam ecosystem. Users can log in with a Metamask or Talisman wallet. There are two parties, the expense creator and the debtor(s). In order to get started, the creator connects its wallet and creates an expense.

The creator then selects the debtors addressesâ€™ and the amount that each one will pay. Debtors then access the received expense and are able to pay the debt, all the debt in one transaction. The debtor can select the token in which it wants to pay, and the creator will receive it on its desired selected token.

## Future for Astroshare
The following features are planned to be added.

- Implementation of Ethereum Name Service (ENS domains)
- Ability to cancel an expense with automatic refund to the parties that had paid.
- Share link button to send expense efficiently to the debtors.
- Notifications implementation (Push Protocol)
- Anti spam system. Only your contacts can add you to an expense.
- More blockchains compatibility.
- Automatic creation of recurring payments.
- Dynamic expense for constantly updating payments.
